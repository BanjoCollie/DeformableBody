# Deformable Body Simulator
A text project that simulates a 3d deformable body with OpenGL.

The scene created is two cows falling and landing on a flat ground.
You can see a video of the program running [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZR1ROPiSJZI) and see some more information [here](https://creativerecurrence.wordpress.com/portfolio/opengl-cloth-pvhysics/)

Source.cpp is driver of the program and contains most of the code. 
Self intersection of the bodies currentlty disabled as it slows the program down too much, though I left the code in in comment blocks. There is a framework for a bounded volume heirarchy also, though I ran out of time working on this project and have left that as it is,
